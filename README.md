#**Burger**

##In this assignment, we create a burger logger with **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**, **Node**, **Express**, **Handlebars** and a homemade **ORM** (yum!). We have followed the **MVC** design pattern; used **Node** and **MySQL** to query and route data in this app, and **Handlebars** to generate the HTML.##

*Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.*

*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, ythis app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.*

*Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour It!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.*

*This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.*
