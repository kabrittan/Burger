# Burger

## In this assignment, we create a burger logger with **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**, **[Node](https://nodejs.org/)**, **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)**, **[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)** and homemade object-relational mapping **(ORM).** We have followed the model-view-controller **(MVC)** design pattern; used **[Node](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** to query and route data in this app, and **[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)** to generate the HTML. ##

*Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.*

*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, ythis app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.*

*Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour It!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.*

*This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.*
